So we made it a year-round beer, and it’s now our bestselling beer and our flagship.\nDescription: Since its introduction, Harpoon IPA has remained unique in its ability to balance hop bitterness with a strong malt backbone. Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.

The scent of fresh raspberries hits the nose immediately, along with a subtle bready aroma from the wheat and yeast.  The body is light and the unfiltered yeast provides a soft mouthfeel.  The taste of the fruit compliments the beer nicely, neither overwhelms the other.  There is a faint sweetness on the palate, which finishes cleanly in a semi-dry, tart finish.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 09:26:35 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":3.409,"rating_count":16721},"brewery":{"brewery_id":634,"brewery_name":"Harpoon Brewery","brewery_slug":"harpoon-brewery","brewery_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-HarpoonBrewery_634.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"harpoonbrewery","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/TheHarpoonBrewery","instagram":"harpoonbrewery","url":"http://www.harpoonbrewery.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Boston","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.3465,"lng":-71.0344},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"has_had":null,"total_count":22746,"beer":{"bid":6721,"beer_name":"UFO Hefeweizen","beer_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-harpoonUFO.jpg","beer_style":"Hefeweizen","beer_abv":4.8,"beer_ibu":0,"beer_slug":"harpoon-brewery-ufo-hefeweizen","beer_description":"The unfiltered yeast remains in suspension, giving this style its signature cloudy color and a soft mouthfeel.

It is brewed using a decoration mash, a time consuming, traditional four vessel brewing process discarded by many contemporary brewers. This process brings forth a rich sweetness from the malt that makes it well worth the effort. Samuel Adams Boston Lager® also uses only the finest of ingredients including two row barley, as well as German Noble aroma hops. The exclusive use of two row barley not only imparts a full, smooth body but also gives the beer a wide spectrum of malt flavor ranging from slightly sweet to caramel to slightly roasted. The Noble hops varieties, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, add a wide range of floral, piney and citrus notes, which are present from the aroma, through the flavor, to the lingering smooth finish. We take great pride in the Noble hops used in our beers. They are hand selected by Jim Koch and our other brewers from the world's oldest hops growing area. Among the world's most expensive, they cost twenty times as much as other hops.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Sat, 21 Aug 2010 09:26:35 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":3.401,"rating_count":204900},"brewery":{"brewery_id":157,"brewery_name":"Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams)","brewery_slug":"boston-beer-company-samuel-adams","brewery_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-157_6026f.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"SamuelAdamsBeer","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/SamuelAdams","instagram":"samueladamsbeer","url":"http://www.samueladams.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Boston","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.3144,"lng":-71.1034},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"has_had":null,"total_count":445801,"beer":{"bid":3942,"beer_name":"Samuel Adams OctoberFest","beer_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-3942_dcf0d_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Oktoberfest/Festbier/Märzen","beer_abv":5.3,"beer_ibu":16,"beer_slug":"boston-beer-company-samuel-adams-samuel-adams-octoberfest","beer_description":" In 1810, the Oktoberfest tradition was born when Munich celebrated the Crown Prince’s wedding with a special beer and 16 day party.

It is made from a blend of local apples, slowly fermented to capture subtle esters, and delicately balanced with a hint of flower-blossom honey. It is the result of countless test batches on dozens of \napple varieties and yeast strains to arrive at just the right combination of flavors, aroma and body.\n\nWunderkind isn't simply a new twist on a familiar \ntheme, it's a new story altogether.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Fri, 23 Mar 2012 17:43:35

Once fermented we “lager” or cold store the ale, which tones down the aroma produced in top fermentation. What’s left is the satisfying aroma of chocolate malt and citrus, followed by a malty, hoppy, and slightly dry taste.

character of truely regional beers. \n\nDescendant is made by brewing a 16 Plato wort from dark roasted barley and fermenting it with Molasses. In re-imagining a Boston Harbor tavern ale we used coffee malt to get a light smoke flavor as would be common with dark beers of yore. Chocolate malt is added to complement the once ubiquitous Boston ingredient: Molasses.  We expected such a beer would be more rustic than todays clean irish stouts and english porters, so we used our house Saison yeast, Renaud to ferment the beer in a traditional warm fermentation. \n\nIs it a Black Saison? A Farmhouse Imperial Porter? A Belgian Dry Stout?  It seems to fit no name so we dubbed it a Suffolk Dark Ale.","is_in_production":1,"created_at":"Wed, 19 Oct 2011 18:12:19 +0000","auth_rating":0,"wish_list":false,"rating_score":3.71,"rating_count":1790},"brewery":{"brewery_id":11459,"brewery_name":"The Mystic Brewery","brewery_slug":"the-mystic-brewery","brewery_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-11459_202fa.jpeg","country_name":"United States","contact":{"twitter":"MysticBrewery","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/MysticBrewery","instagram":"mysticbrewery","url":"http://mystic-brewery.com"},"location":{"brewery_city":"Chelsea","brewery_state":"MA","lat":42.392,"lng":-71.0441},"brewery_active":1},"friends":{"items":[],"count":0}},{"has_had":null,"total_count":2379,"beer":{"bid":330480,"beer_name":"Mary Of The Gael","beer_label":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-330480_60eb8_sm.jpeg","beer_style":"Saison / Farmhouse Ale","beer_abv":6.7,"beer_ibu":21,"beer_slug":"mystic-brewery-mary-of-the-gael","beer_description":"St. Brigid's Day (Mary of the Gael) is celebrated in Ireland at the time of Imbolic, a once pagan celebration of \"Summer in the Belly of Winter.\" This release in our series of seasonal saisons is a refreshingly hoppy take on saison for springtime.
